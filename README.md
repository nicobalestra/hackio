# hackedio

Project developed during the hacked.IO event at the O2 arena in London.

This project shows how to use a nanoKONTROLLER2 midi controller to randomly chose which a track to play, change the pitch, tempo and at the same time to control light bulbs on a 3 bulbs Philip HUE.

Philip HUE can be controlled by invoking REST APIs exposed by the "bridge" where the lights are connected.
clj-http has been used to make such calls.

## Usage

There's nothing you can do unless you have a nanoKONTROLLER2 and a Philips Hue unfortunately :(
